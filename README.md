Weather Data Dashboard 

Created a visualization dashboard website based on weather data created in the earlier Weather Study.  The same weather elements (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Windspeed) were used in creating the individual html pages.  A landing page describing the project and displays a navigation bar as well as interactive charts of the weather elements that when clicked will take the user to that specific html page.  Each page has a chart and how the weather element is affected as it nears the equator.  

The Navigation bar allows the user the option of using the Drop Down Menu "Plots" to navigate the site.  The Data Button will bring the user to another html page displaying the data used in the study.   The users also have the option of using the Comparison to see all four data elements in the same web page.  Screen shots of the visualization is located in Visulaization Folder and identified by the name of the different weather elements.
